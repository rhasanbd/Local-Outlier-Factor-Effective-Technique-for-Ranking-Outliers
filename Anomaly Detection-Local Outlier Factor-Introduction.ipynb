    "# Local Outlier Factor\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "        What is the motivation for the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm?\n",
    "        \n",
    "Most of the anomaly detection techniques consider being an outlier or anomaly as a **binary property**. That is, either an object in the dataset is an outlier or not. For many applications, the situation is more complex. It is more meaningful to assign to each object **a degree of being an outlier**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the idea behind the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) anomaly detection technique. \n",
    "\n",
    "It was proposed by Markus M. Breunig, Hans-Peter Kriegel, Raymond T. Ng and Jörg Sander in 2000 for finding anomalous data points by measuring the local deviation of a given data point with respect to its neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/Publikationen/Papers/LOF.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Local vs Global Outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "The LOF algorithm is designed to detect local outliers. Let’s try to understand the concept of local outliers by comparing it with global outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following example shows a simple 2D dataset containing 502 objects. There are 400 objects in the first cluster $C_1$, 100 objects in the cluster $C_2$, and two additional objects $o_1$ and $o_2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "- In this example, $C_2$ forms a denser cluster than $C_1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, $o_1$ can be called a global outlier. But $o_2$ is **not a global outlier**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The density of $o_2$ to its nearest neighbors is not different from the density $C_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, $o_2$ is probably an outlier compared to the nearest neighbors’ density.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of LOF is to identify both $o_1$ and $o_2$ as outliers. \n",
    "\n",

    "## LOF: Insight of the Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm compares the density of instances around a given instance to the density around its neighbors. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the figure below, the instance A has a much lower density than its neighbors, hence could be an anomaly or outlier. An outlier is often more isolated than its $k$ nearest neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "LOF score of a data point reflects its degree of abnormality. In LOF, the outlier rank of a data object is determined by taking into account the clustering structure in a bounded neighborhood of the object. This is formally defined as **local outlier factor** (LOF) score. \n",
    "\n",
    "The LOF score measures the local density deviation of a given data point with respect to its neighbors. The idea is to detect the samples that have a substantially lower density than their neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice the local density is obtained from the $k$ nearest neighbors. \n",
    "\n",
    "The LOF score of an observation is equal to the ratio of the average local density of his k-nearest neighbors, and its own local density: \n",
    "\n",
    "- A normal instance is expected to have a local density similar to that of its neighbors.\n",
    "- An abnormal data or outlier is expected to have much smaller local density. I.e. an outlier should have large LOF value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://cse.unl.edu/~hasan/Pics/LocalOutlierFactor.png\" width=300, height=150>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## LOF Values for Inliers and Outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "Following range of the LOF is used to determine an inlier/outlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $LOF(k) \\sim 1$ means Similar density as neighbors (thus not an outlier).\n",
    "- $LOF(k) < 1$ means Higher density than neighbors (Inlier).\n",
    "- $LOF(k) > 1$ means Lower density than neighbors (Outlier).\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, $LOF(k) > 1$ is used to identify an outlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it depends on the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## LOF: Main Advantage\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The strength of the LOF algorithm is that it takes both local and global properties of datasets into consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, it can perform well even in datasets where abnormal samples have different underlying densities. \n",
    "\n",
    "The question is not, how isolated the sample is, but how isolated it is with respect to the surrounding neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## LOF: Main Disadvantage\n",
    "\n",
    "LOF suffers from the \"curse of dimensionlity\".\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a distance-based method. Thus, the problems found in distance-based methods will be encountered in LOF (i.e., “curse of dimensionality”).\n",
    "\n",
    "The direct application of distance-based methods to high dimensional problems often results in unexpected performance and qualitative costs due to the \"curse of dimensionality\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time-Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "The main contribution to the time-complexity of LOF comes from finding the $k$ nearest neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each point it scans all points in the dataset, computes distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Thus, the worst-case run-time complexity is $O(n^2)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "If an **indexing structure** is used that executes a neighborhood query in $O(log n)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Thus, an overall average run-time complexity is: $O(n log n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "            if a float, the contamination should be in the range [0, 0.5].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the sklearn LocalOutlierFactor object does not return the LOF values. Instead it returns the negative of the LOF values.\n",

    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to understand **how to select an optimal value for $k$ (number of nearest neighbors)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting a suitable value for $k$ is tricky and depends on the dataset. We need to have an understanding of the structure of the clusters of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Breunig et al. (inventor of LOF) provides a heuristic for the selection of optimal $k$. For computing the LOF values for the data points, they suggest to use a range of $k$s.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, for each data point\n",
    "- Choose a minimum $k$ and a maximum $k$.\n",
    "- Compute LOF for each $k$ in that range. \n",
    "- Take maximum LOF value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Guideline for Choosing a Minimum $k$ and a Maximum $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Minimum $k$: should be greater than the minimum number of samples a cluster has to contain, so that other samples can be local outliers relative to this cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "        This lower bound refers to the minimal cluster size which consists of similar behaving points. This means that we consider a cluster of points with a size lower than minimum k value to be represented as outliers. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Maximum $k$: should be smaller than the maximum number of nearby samples that can potentially be local outliers. \n",
    "\n",
    "        Thus, if we decide that maximum m points can stay in close proximity as outliers without being considered as a cluster of normal points, then, m should be the upper bound for k.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand the optimal setting of the range of $k$, we perform following five tasks. For these tasks we create two types of data distribution (no outlier and some outliers).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Two clusters of similar density\n",
    "\n",
    "        There are no outliers. Thus, all points will have similar LOF. Varying k won't make any difference.\n",
    "        \n",
    "2. A single cluster and few distant data points\n",
    "\n",
    "        The distant points can be considered as outliers. Thus, for a suitable range of values of k, these distant points should have large LOF (i.e., they are outliers).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Task 1: Analyze the effect of various $k$ on two clusters of similar density\n",
    "- Task 2: Analyze the effect of various $k$ on a single cluster and few distant points\n",
    "- Task 3: Effect of small $k$ on a single cluster and few distant points\n",
    "- Task 4: Effect of large $k$ on a single cluster and few distant points\n",
    "- Task 5: Use an optimal range for $k$ for a single cluster and few distant points"
